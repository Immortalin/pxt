# High Contrast

The high contrast helps people to locate and distinguish between the different visual elements in the MakeCode editor. This is enabled by each MakeCode target with its own use of color and contrast. So, a high contrast view is not always available in every instance of a MakeCode editor (partner editions).

The high contrast mode in the editor is available even when the operating system configuration hasn't enabled it. In MakeCode, it is enabled manually from either the ``Hidden Tab Menu`` or the ``Settings`` menu.
