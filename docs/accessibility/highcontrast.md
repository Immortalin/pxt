# High Contrast

The high contrast allows people with vision impairment to have a better experience in **Microsoft MakeCode**. It is not available on all our partner's MakeCode editor yet.

The high contrast mode can be enabled independently from the operating system configuration. Therefore, it can be enabled manually from the ``Hidden Tab Menu`` or from the ``Settings`` menu.
