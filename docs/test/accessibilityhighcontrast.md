# Testing high contrast

The high contrast mode helps people with vision impairment to read the screen. The goal of this mode is to increase the contrast between the text, interactive element and the background. For example, a white text on black background is easier to read than a light grey text on a white background.

The high contrast mode can be enabled independently from the operating system configuration. Therefore, it can be enabled manually from the ``Hidden Tab Menu`` or from the ``Settings`` menu.

As there are variations between the high contrast mode of the website and the render when the high contrast modes of the hosting operating system are enabled, the guideline to test the high contrast is simply to be sure that all text and interactive elements are well visible and that the focus is visible enough to be determine with a low vision on which component we are navigating.
