# Accessibility

The **Microsoft MakeCode** team wants to be sure that every person on the planet can play with it to achieve more. It is very important for us when we're working to make computer science more accessible to consumers with disabilities.

## Being responsible

Starting from August 2017, every contributor and MakeCode team member will be responsible to insure the accessibility of their own features or changes. The following documentation must help to understand what is important to keep in mind while designing and developing MakeCode.

## Accessible Rich Internet Applications (WAI-ARIA) 1.1

ARIA + Everybody is responsible of his own accessibility features.
